<Summary>
    <p>When you go to a retail shop for your flowers, you are relying on what the company has already purchased within their 
        budget at wholesale cost, and thus there is no risk on their end. They also tend to charge only 25% labor cost for any
        given arrangement, where as a wedding/event studio will special order your (more than likely) luxury flowers that will
        cost more wholesale, and they are taking on the risk of you canceling your order. They also tend to be much more difficult
        type arrangements and so they will charge no less than a 50% labor fee</p>
